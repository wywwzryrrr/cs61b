## Classes and Data Structures

### Commit
Represents a Commit.

#### Fields

1. `String message`: The message that user input when committing.
2. `String timestamp`: The timestamp when committing a file, generated by a helper method.
3. `Stirng parent`: The parent commitUID.
4. `String secondParent`: The second parent commitUID specifically designed for merge method, a default commit should be null in this parameter.
5. `TreeMap<String, String> blob`: The snapshots of files of this commit. The keys are files in CWD with absolute path. The values are blobs in BLOBS_DIR.
6. `String UID`: The SHA-1 id of this commit


### Blob

#### Fields

1. `String content`: `Utils.readContentAsString(file)`
2. `String UID`: `Utils.sha1(content)`

### Commands

#### Fields

1. `init`: initialize gitlet repository.
2. `commit`: to make a commit.
3. `add`: add a copy of file to staging area.
4. `rm`: add a copy of file to stage for removal, and clear the file in stage for addition if it exists.
5. `log`: print the commit UID, message and timestamp chronologically.
6. `global log`: like log, but the order is not considered.
7. `find`: prints out the ids of all commits that have the given commit message, one per line.
8. `branch`: create a new branch with the given name.
9. `rmbranch`: remove the branch with the given name.
10. `status`: Displays what branches currently exist, and marks the current branch with a *. Also displays what files have been staged for addition or removal.
11. `checkoutFile`: change the file with the given filename to the version in head commit.
12. `checkoutCommitFile`: change the file with the given filename to the version in the commit of given commitUID
13. `checkoutBranch`: change the CWD to the given branch's version
14. `reset`: checkout all the file tracked by the given commitUID
15. `merge`: merge the files in two branches according to different situations

## Algorithms
* TreeMap
* Hashing
* BFS

## Persistence

```

+ `HEAD` file: stores the current branch's path.
+ `heads` directory in `refs` : stores different branch; name is branch name, content is the commit id on the tip of the branch.
+ `blobs` directory: stores all Blob objects, name is sha-1 UID according to a file's content.
+ `commits` directory: stores all commits, name is commitUID, content is a TreeMap.
+ `stage` directory: staging area contains `add` and `remove`, witch represent stage for addition and stage for removal respectively.
